# Entities & Entities Services

An entity is a generic term for Models and/or Collections.
All interfacing with the server should be done through the entities or the entity services.

The entity services are a service class specifically for gathering a particular entity to some set specifications.
Once the entity has been requested interface with the entity directly for fetching or posting data.
